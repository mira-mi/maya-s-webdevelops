            <h2>The Open-Ended Prompts</h2>
            <p>These were of my own design. My teacher wanted us to let our creative juices flow in this 
                assignments. These were extremely fun and challenged me to use my imagination to the fullest.
                I hope you enjoy these!

            <h2>The Recreation Prompts</h2>
            <p>These were a challenge in itself. We were tasked to copy a website exactly as we saw
                it. They were interesting and helped me perfect my skills in this class. They are shown
                below.
