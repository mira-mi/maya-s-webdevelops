          <h2>The Ups of Being a Cashier</h2>
          <p>This is the honda dealership above (I actually work there)</p>
          <p>So, work at a dealership does has it's perks. Most of the time you are able to sit around and not do too much until a customer comes over to pay or for help. You take a lot of phone calls for customers that need help. You can do assignments and deal with a lot of things daily before you even have to do anything anything else or even deal with a customer. </p>
          <p>It's not like you don't have work while you're there. It's pretty straightforward. You take in money from payments in various forms. You make sure the customer has their copy of the paperwork, you also can try to explain what the service advisor did to your car or they could talk to their advisor themselves. You receipt it and close it out and that's that.  </p>
          <p>The environment is very family friendly and you will enjoy your time here at a dealership. It would make you pretty happy but just know there are plenty of downs that make the time less enjoyable.</p>

          <h2>The Downs of Being a Cashier</h2>
          <p>There are plenty of downs but let's talk about the current ones. There is no hard close time. It says we close at 9pm but we don't sometimes. Sometimes it's 9:45 or 10:20 pm. That's one issue and that's not even the half of it. Having to pick up the slack of another cashier whose been there for a year, is annoying as well. The other issue is that the salesmen make no sales until almost closing time. People sadly exist and their entitlement is huge sadly. </p>
          <p>The crazy thing is sometimes people literally take back their purchases same day. So you take in the money and they decide they don't want it anymore and sales gets upset that they can't keep the money and treats the customer like crap for realizing the car was an absolute lemon. Then the other issue is that they forget about the cashier so much that you have to leave your office so many times so they don't forget about you.</p>
          <p>It's a crazy job sometimes is how I'll end it.</p>
