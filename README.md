# Maya Does Web Development
## Personal Introductions
For this assignment, I had to follow an HTML crash-course, create a quick web page that you can use to supplement a quick introduction of yourself to the class. This was the criteria.
- What’s your preferred name (what should we call you)?
- What’s your favorite color?
- What’s an artwork you like? (If it’s a time-based work, we won’t have time to watch it right now, but feel free to add it anyway!)
- Something you’re super excited about (anything!)
- Something you’re super NOT excited about (anything!)
- Something you recommend (anything! A book, an artist, a movie, show, video game, ice cream flavor, life philosophy, a keyboard (or a keyboard shortcut), a lifehack, literally anything

## Single Column Page
This was to make a responsive webpage.

## Single Column Page (Deluxe)
This was the criteria
- Similar to last week's assignment, the structure of your page should follow the same semantic <header>, <main>, <footer> structure.
- Include at least 2 images (they can come from anywhere)
- Create a color scheme with at least 3 colors in your CSS using custom properties (use poolors.comLinks to an external site. as a starting point if you'd like)
- Import 2 different Google fonts, where one is used for your headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.), and one is used for your body text.
- Create at least 2 sections with IDs that you link to from your <nav> section. (remember to use scroll-behavior: smooth;)
The content, colors and fonts can be whatever you want, as long as you satisfy the guidelines above.
