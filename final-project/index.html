        <p>This is the about section. This page is for a minor hobby of mine that everyone seemes to think that 
            I do a great job of doing. My mom and fiance believe that this is a gift that I should take part in and
            make some money off of. I, however, think the hobby is just that. I want to show my skills and tell my 
            creative mindset while doing this assignment and creating a nice webpage. 
        </p>
        <p>This is a collection of pictures that I have acquired ove the years using three different types of cameras,
            such as a canon camera, a samsung note 10, and currently a samsung s22 ultra. The quality has been upgraded 
            over the years. I hope you can enjoy all these pictures! If want more you should follow, this
