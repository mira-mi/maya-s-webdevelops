        <p>This is the about section. This page is for a minor hobby of mine that everyone seemes to think that 
            I do a great job of doing. My mom and fiance believe that this is a gift that I should take part in and
            make some money off of. I, however, think the hobby is just that. I want to show my skills and tell my 
            creative mindset while doing this assignment and creating a nice webpage. 
        </p>
        <p>This is a collection of pictures that I have acquired over the years using three different types of cameras,
            such as a canon camera, a samsung note 10, and currently a samsung s22 ultra. The quality has been upgraded 
            over the years. I hope you can enjoy all these pictures! If want more you should follow, this
            <a href="page1.html">link</a>!

        <h2>More about the Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The inspiration comes from me wanting the best vantage point as well as having an amazing set of photos to look 
            through to find the perfect ones to put on this site. It'll probably be a lot of cars that I have photographed 
            but I do have more on the Quick Insight tab above the Ford truck picture.
