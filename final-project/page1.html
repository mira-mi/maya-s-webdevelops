        <p>Hi, my name is Maya K. Hunter. I am 22 years old and I created this to show all the pictures I took while at 
            work as well as the autoshow. Tthe taking pictres of cars started with Midnight, a strange colored camry that I 
            have been driving for almost four years. It's shown below. She's the one who started the journey on taking pictures
            of cars. They are the perfect subject for pictures because they don't move. At least in my opinion.
        </p>
