        <p>Hi, my name is Maya K. Hunter. I am 22 years old and I created this to show all the pictures I took while at 
            work as well as the autoshow. Tthe taking pictres of cars started with Midnight, a strange colored camry that I 
            have been driving for almost four years. It's shown below. She's the one who started the journey on taking pictures
            of cars. They are the perfect subject for pictures because they don't move. At least in my opinion.

        <p>This is Midnight. The reason that I started taking pictures of cars. The journey started when I started washing cars
            and trying to get extra business. I ended up making it a hobby. Thus you have a car photography page that shows my inspiration for all the cars 
            I see at work as well as this one, the current one I drive.
